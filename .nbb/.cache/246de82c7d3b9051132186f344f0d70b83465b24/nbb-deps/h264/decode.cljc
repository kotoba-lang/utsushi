  "H.264 baseline-profile reference pixel decoder — NAL → SPS/PPS → IDR
   I-slice → macroblock loop → (Intra_16x16 prediction + CAVLC residual +
   dequant + inverse transform) → reconstructed luma plane. Pure cljc,
   NON-REALTIME reference implementation (ADR-2607122000 \"R0.5\": a
   correctness-first golden model, not a claim of realtime decode
   performance — see `com-junkawasaki/root` ADR-2607122000 and the R0
   opaque / R1 capability-gated-native-host-word phases it doesn't
   replace).

   ## Scope (read before assuming this decodes arbitrary H.264)

   - **Single IDR I-slice per picture, one slice per picture** — no
     multi-slice, no P/B slices, no multiple reference frames, no
     multi-frame GOP structure.
   - **Baseline profile, CAVLC only** (no CABAC).
   - **mb_type: Intra_16x16 ONLY** (`mb_type` 1..24). `mb_type` 0
     (`I_NxN`/Intra_4x4/Intra_8x8, requiring per-4x4-block adaptive
     prediction-mode signaling) and 25 (`I_PCM`) THROW rather than being
     silently mis-decoded.
   - **Intra_16x16 luma prediction modes: DC/Vertical/Horizontal (0/1/2)
     only** — mode 3 (Plane) throws.
   - **Chroma (Cb/Cr): ChromaArrayType 1 (4:2:0) only, DC/Horizontal/
     Vertical Intra_Chroma prediction (modes 0/1/2 per Table 8-5's OWN
     numbering — a different permutation than luma's, see
     `h264.intra-pred`) — mode 3 (Plane) throws.** Chroma DC (nC==-1
     special CAVLC table) and chroma AC (regular neighbor-derived 4x4
     blocks, reusing the luma AC path with QPc instead of QPy) are both
     implemented — this is new as of the chroma-decode follow-up to Phase 1
     (see \"Pixel decode\" below); any other `chroma_format_idc` throws.
   - **No deblocking filter** — `h264.slice` reads and discards the
     deblocking-control fields; the reconstructed picture is the raw
     (pre-deblock) reconstruction. This only matters at block boundaries
     with real pixel discontinuities; it does not affect this repo's own
     flat/gradient golden vectors (see `test/h264/decode_test.clj`).
   - **No POC/reference-picture-buffer bookkeeping beyond what's needed to
     parse a single slice header.**

   Given these constraints, `decode-idr-frame` returns decoded luma AND
   chroma planes ({:luma :cb :cr}, each a flat byte vector, row-major,
   values 0..255 — luma is width*height, Cb/Cr are each (width/2)*(height/2)
   per 4:2:0 subsampling) for a picture whose width/height (from SPS) are
   exact multiples of 16 (no frame cropping — matches `h264.sps/encode`'s
   own encode-side limitation elsewhere in this repo).

   New implementation as part of the kotoba-lang reverse-domain
   media/graphics standards-substrate split (com-junkawasaki/root),
   ADR-2607122000 Phase 1 (\"R0.5\") + a chroma-decode / multi-macroblock
   V/H-prediction follow-up."

(def blk->col-row
  "H.264 4x4 luma block index (0..15, CAVLC/residual decode order — the
   spec's `luma4x4BlkIdx`, Figure 6-10) → [col row] (both 0..3) within the
   macroblock's 4x4-block grid.

   The four 4x4 blocks 0..15 group into FOUR 8x8 quadrants in raster order
   (TL=0-3, TR=4-7, BL=8-11, BR=12-15 — GLOBAL quadrant positions [0,0]
   [2,0] [0,2] [2,2] respectively), and WITHIN each quadrant the four 4x4
   sub-blocks are ALSO in plain raster order (TL,TR,BL,BR — col varies
   fastest, matching `h264.decode/chroma-blk->col-row`'s 2x2 raster
   convention, NOT a column-major/Z-order variant).

   PREVIOUSLY (through the chroma-decode/multi-MB-V/H-prediction
   development session) this table used an INCORRECT column-major variant
   (`{0 [0 0], 1 [0 1], 2 [1 0], ...}` — row and col swapped relative to
   the mapping above, i.e. a transpose of the correct table) that was
   believed \"empirically validated\" by the single-macroblock
   `gradient16-ac.h264` fixture and the multi-macroblock
   `chroma-multimb32.h264` fixture. Both fixtures' LUMA content is
   direction-degenerate in a way that can't distinguish a transposed block
   mapping from the correct one (a single-MB horizontal gradient has no
   cross-MB neighbor to expose it; the multimb32 fixture's luma is flat).
   The bug was only exposed by a genuinely cross-macroblock, row-varying
   (not column-varying) multi-MB luma test — where libx264 selected
   Intra_16x16 Horizontal prediction — via a real desync/wrong-pixel
   investigation (see README \"Pixel decode\" and ADR history around the
   Horizontal-prediction multi-macroblock golden vector). The correct
   mapping was independently re-derived (and cross-checked three ways) from
   FFmpeg's OWN source: (1) `scan8[]`'s neighbor-addressing formula
   (`libavcodec/h264dec.h`/callers), (2) the `ref_index`/`scan8[0|4|8|12]`
   8x8-partition assignment in `ff_h264_slice_context_init`
   (`libavcodec/h264dec.c`), and (3) the explicit `dc_mapping[16]` table in
   `hl_decode_mb_idct_luma` (`libavcodec/h264_mb.c`, the
   `transform_bypass`/lossless path, which spells out DC-raster-position →
   block-index numerically) — all three agree exactly on the mapping below.
   `h264.transform/luma-dc-hadamard`'s own arithmetic (`x_offset`/`stride`,
   kept as a byte-for-byte port of `ff_h264_luma_dc_dequant_idct`) already
   produces its 16-element output correctly indexed by this SAME true
   block numbering (verified: `out[16*k]` for k=0..15 lines up exactly with
   `stride*R+offset` for the (loop-i, R) combination that
   `ff_h264_luma_dc_dequant_idct`'s caller — `sl->mb + p*256` — treats as
   block-major storage). It ALSO needs its OWN input transposed first
   (see `h264.transform/luma-dc-hadamard`'s docstring) — the two bugs
   compound: without the input transpose, the DC-Hadamard-derived values
   vary along the wrong screen axis (column instead of row for row-varying
   content) regardless of which `blk->col-row` is used; fixing only one of
   the two still fails."

   IMPORTANT bitstream-order note (§7.3.5.3.3 `residual_block_cavlc`/
   ffmpeg's `ff_h264_decode_mb_cavlc`): the actual NAL bit order for an
   Intra_16x16 macroblock's chroma residual is [Cb DC, Cr DC, Cb AC x4, Cr
   AC x4] — ALL DC blocks (both components) before ANY AC blocks, NOT
   [Cb DC, Cb AC x4, Cr DC, Cr AC x4] (i.e. NOT fully decoding one
   component before starting the other). This fn intentionally does ONLY
   the AC read for a single component — callers (`h264.decode/decode-macroblock!`)
   MUST call `decode-chroma-dc!` for BOTH components first, THEN call this
   fn for both components, to match that order. Getting this wrong
   silently desyncs the bit reader partway through the FIRST macroblock
   that has real chroma AC residual (`cbp-chroma` == 2) — caught via a real
   multi-macroblock color-gradient golden vector during development (DC-
   only fixtures don't exercise this order at all).

   The 4 chroma 4x4 sub-blocks use `chroma-blk->col-row` (plain raster
   order — NOT the same block-index convention as luma's `blk->col-row`,
   see that def's docstring for the empirical mismatch this caused).
   `dc-quad` is ALSO raster order (idx = row*2+col), so with
   `chroma-blk->col-row` the two indices coincide (`b == row*2+col`) —
   overlaying a block's DC value is a direct `(nth dc-quad b)`, no
   remapping needed.

  "CABAC counterpart of `decode-chroma-ac-blocks!`. Unlike CAVLC's nC
   (an average of neighbor total_coeff), CABAC's `coded_block_flag` neighbor
   term is a plain boolean (`total_coeff > 0`), with a DIFFERENT
   unavailable-neighbor default — NOT unconditionally `true`: per
   OpenH264's `ParseCbfInfoCabac` (`nA = nB =
   !!IS_INTRA(pMbType[iCurrBlkXy])` — the CURRENT macroblock's OWN
   intra/inter-ness, not the neighbor's), the default is `true` ONLY when
   THIS macroblock is intra, `false` when THIS macroblock is inter — this
   fn is shared by BOTH `decode-intra-macroblock-body-cabac!` (always
   passes `intra?` true) and `decode-inter-16x16-macroblock-cabac!`
   (always passes `intra?` false), so it CANNOT hardcode the old
   intra-only-scope default the way this fn's I-slice-only predecessor
   could (see ADR-2607122000 P-slice CABAC increment's own root-cause
   note: an earlier version of this fn — and the analogous luma-block
   unavailable-default in `decode-inter-16x16-macroblock-cabac!` — DID
   hardcode `true` unconditionally, copied from the intra-only path
   without adjusting for the inter case, causing real multi-macroblock
   content to decode a wrong `coded_block_flag` context state whenever an
   inter macroblock had an unavailable neighbor — caught via a real
   libx264 CABAC P-slice fixture whose reconstructed pixels were
   plausible-shaped but numerically wrong compared to ffmpeg's own
   decode). Mirrors `decode-chroma-ac-blocks!`'s cross-block-boundary

   reads one context-coded `mb_skip_flag` bin PER macroblock address (see
   `h264.cabac/read-mb-skip-flag!`), then (if not skipped) a full
   `macroblock_layer()`; `end_of_slice_flag` (`decode_terminate!`) is read
   after EVERY address regardless of skip/not-skip — same
   asserted-exactly-at-the-last-address discipline as
   `decode-i-slice-mbs-cabac!` above. Byte-aligns `r`
   (`cabac_alignment_one_bit`) and initializes the arithmetic engine +

   uses ONE of 3 `cabac_init_idc`-selected columns, unlike I-slice's single
   fixed column, see `h264.cabac/init-contexts`) ONCE for the whole slice.

   Threads `last-dqp` (the running \"previous macroblock's own
   `mb_qp_delta`\" state `mb_qp_delta`'s OWN ctxIdxInc depends on) forward

   the actual decoded delta otherwise.

   1`, throwing otherwise — a real multi-frame reference-picture buffer/DPB
   is out of scope).

   A single SPS/PPS pair (the first of each found in the whole stream) is
   assumed to apply to every picture — matches real encoders, which
   typically emit SPS/PPS once before the IDR frame and don't repeat them
   per P-frame (this repo doesn't handle mid-stream SPS/PPS changes).
