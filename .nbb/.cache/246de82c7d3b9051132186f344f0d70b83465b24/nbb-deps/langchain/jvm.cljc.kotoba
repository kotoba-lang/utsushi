(ns langchain.jvm
  "The JVM host-fn reference implementation langchain-clj's pure core
  deliberately doesn't ship (model adapters take :http-fn/:json-write/
  :json-read as injected capabilities so the same adapter runs on JVM,
  ClojureScript, SCI, and Clojure-on-WASM) — plus the app-facing
  conveniences every JVM consumer of this pattern needed identically:
  offline-mock ChatModel fallback, JSON/EDN structured-output parsing, and
  vision message-building. Originally extracted from mangaka.llm /
  animeka.llm (near-duplicate copies sharing this shape but different
  providers — mangaka: Anthropic direct, animeka: the murakumo fleet's
  OpenAI-compatible gateway) into a short-lived `kotoba-lang/genapp-clj`,
  then landed here — its natural home next to the pure core it wires. See
  90-docs/adr/2607011816-ghosthacker-shiropico-standalone-repo.md and
  90-docs/adr/2607011900-genapp-clj-mangaka-animeka-commons.md for the
  history. Provider construction (`anthropic-model`/`openai-model`/…) stays
  app-specific, injected here as a `build-live` thunk."
