  "The T5 contract: what a piece of hardware IS, as validated data.

  Every hardware-shaped decision in this stack — field layout, traversal
  order, page-cache sizing, I/O batching, GPU launch geometry — needs the
  same handful of numbers: how wide a cache line is, how big a page is, how
  many bytes fit in L2, how deep a device queue runs. Before this namespace
  those numbers lived nowhere, so each planner would have had to invent its
  own constants. Constants invented per planner is exactly how an
  optimization fossil forms: a number that was true on the machine someone
  measured in 2026 and silently wrong everywhere after.

  So a descriptor is data, it is validated, and — this is the part that
  matters — **it carries its own provenance**. `:measured` means someone ran
  something on the actual device. `:vendor-declared` means it came off a
  datasheet. `:assumed` means it is a portable floor nobody measured.
  `perfgate` refuses to qualify a performance claim built on `:assumed`
  numbers, which is the mechanism that stops a guess from hardening into a
  fact.

  This namespace deliberately does NOT probe. Reading `sysctl`, `cpuid`,
  `/sys/devices/system/cpu`, `navigator.gpu.limits` or a `WGSLLanguageFeatures`
  set is a host effect; a contract that performs effects cannot be a contract.
  A host builds a descriptor and hands it in.

  Pure `.cljc`, zero dependencies, no host objects."

  "How the walk that pays the translation cost is shaped.

  A dependent chain has no memory-level parallelism to hide a page walk
  behind; a streaming walk has plenty. That is a real difference in mechanism,
  and it is why the fact carries a curve per regime rather than one curve.

  **It is not, on this part, a large difference in magnitude — and the figure
  that once said otherwise was an artifact.** An earlier version of the probe
  touched one line per page at offset 0, so every touched line sat 16 KiB
  apart and congruent to the same cache sets; the resulting 5x was mostly L1
  conflict, not translation. De-confounded and measured across three runs, the
  two regimes overlap at the only page count both cover: `:dependent` at 512
  pages reads 1.17-1.55x and `:streaming` reads 1.09-1.48x.

  So the reason `translation-penalty` refuses to guess is not that the numbers
  are far apart here. It is that a machine measures the regimes separately,
  and silently answering with one regime's curve when asked for the other
  returns a number about a different walk. On a part where the TLB is smaller
  relative to the working set than this one, that number could be far off; on
  this one it happens not to be, and neither the caller nor this function
  knows which case it is in."

  **Bandwidth is a property of the machine AND the access pattern.** The same
  part measured here gives 24 GB/s to a line-strided walk, 34 at a 1 KiB
  stride and 11.5 at the 16 KiB page size, where the TLB gives out — a 3x
  spread. Handing a planner the wrong end of that range is not a rounding
  error: it made one model predict a 1.00x speedup where measurement showed
  2.69x.

  Documenting \"pass the right constant\" did not stop that happening twice, so
  the curve lives in the descriptor and this reads it. Returns `nil` when the
  machine carries no measured curve, which is the usual `require-fact`
  contract — a planner must ask out loud rather than default.

  **A curve is specific to the runtime that measured it, not only to the
  machine.** On the part this was developed against, a C loop and a JVM loop
  disagree by 4x at a 128-byte stride and by under 10% at 16 KiB, and the
  curves differ in shape as well as scale. Record which runtime produced it —
  `:source` and `:runtime` exist for that — and do not hand a JVM-measured
  curve to a model of native code.

  Between measured points it takes the **nearer-lower** stride's figure, which
  is the pessimistic side: real curves fall as stride grows, so rounding down
  the stride rounds up the bandwidth only when the caller asked past the last
  measured point, and that case returns the last (lowest) entry instead."

(defn translation-penalty
  "How much slower a walk gets from spreading over `pages` pages, as a ratio.

  Address translation is a cost the byte-counting models do not see: the same
  bytes, the same cache pressure, spread over more pages, cost more.

  **How much more is smaller than this docstring used to claim.** It said 16.8
  ns per access at 16 pages against 84.5 at 2048, a 5x spread. That probe put
  every touched line at a page boundary, so the lines were mutually congruent
  in the cache and most of the 5x was conflict rather than translation. With
  the addresses staggered, the same sweep gives about 1.5-1.8x at 2048 pages.

  The fact still earns its place -- a byte-counting model sees none of even
  1.5x, and `traversal/pages-touched` exists because a tile's page footprint
  is not implied by its size. But it is a modest effect on this part, not the
  dominant one an earlier reading suggested.

  **The regime is not optional and has no default.** That same spread costs
  1.36x rather than 5x when the walk streams instead of chasing pointers, and
  the gap is the whole point of the fact: a planner handed the pointer-chase
  figure will size tiles against a cost a streaming loop never pays. Callers
  name `:dependent` or `:streaming`; an unknown regime throws rather than
  falling back, because a silent fallback here is a 4x error.

  Returns `nil` when the machine carries no measured curve for that regime —
  the usual `require-fact` contract, where a planner must ask out loud.

  Between measured points it takes the **nearer-lower** page count, which is
  the optimistic side: penalty rises with pages, so a caller sitting between
  two measurements is told the cheaper of the two. That is deliberate — this
  number's job is to warn about a real cost, and rounding it up would let it
  veto tiles on evidence that was never measured."
