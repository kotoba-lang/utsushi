(ns langchain.kotoba-db
  "Kotoba-server XRPC backend implementing the langchain.db/api contract.

  Instead of an in-process EAV store, every operation is a POST to a
  running kotoba-server pod via the datomic.* XRPC namespace:

    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.transact  → :transact!
    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.q         → :q
    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.pull      → :pull
    ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.entid     → :entid

  Pass the kotoba-api map as :db-api to datomic-checkpointer,
  langchain.memory/datomic-chat-history, etc.:

    (require '[langchain.kotoba-db    :as kdb]
             '[langgraph.checkpoint   :as cp])

    (def conn (kdb/kotoba-conn \"http://pod:8080\" \"k51...\"))
    (def api  (kdb/kotoba-api  jvm-host-caps))
    (def cp   (cp/datomic-checkpointer conn {:db-api api}))

  I/O is fully injected (ADR-0001) — host-caps shape matches langchain.model:
    {:http-fn   (fn [{:keys [url method headers body]}] => {:status n :body s})
     :json-write (fn [clj-data] => json-string)
     :json-read  (fn [json-string] => clj-data with keyword keys)}"

  "Creates a kotoba connection map (not an atom — state lives on the server).

   url   – kotoba-server base URL, e.g. \"http://149.28.207.62:8080\"
   graph – IPNS name or CID multibase of the target named graph. Still sent
           as the wire `graph` param — required for reading a pre-established,
           non-tenant-scoped graph (e.g. `KG-GRAPH-CID`), and kept for
           backward compat with every existing caller of this fn.
   opts  – :token   Bearer JWT
           :cacao   base64-CBOR CACAO string (for CACAO-gated endpoints)
           :did     DID string (required with :cacao; sent as x-kotoba-did)
           :db-name tenant database name. When present, `kotoba-api`'s
                    `:transact!` sends `db_name` (not `graph`) on the wire —
                    the edge derives + verifies the target graph
                    server-side as `kotobase/db/<your-did>/<db-name>` from
                    the CACAO alone, which the live edge now REQUIRES for a
                    tenant Datom write (`db_name required for a tenant
                    Datom write` — a plain `:graph` param is rejected on
                    `datomic.transact`).
           :graph   precomputed graph CID (e.g. `kotoba.cid/canonical-graph`
                    or `tsumugu.cacao/canonical-graph` for `<did>/<db-name>`).
                    `kotoba-api`'s `:q`/`:pull`/`:entid` need THIS (not
                    `db_name`) — empirically, the live edge's read ops don't
                    derive the tenant graph from `db_name`+CACAO the way
                    `transact` does; a `db_name`-only read silently matches
                    nothing (200 OK, empty rows) rather than erroring. Pass
