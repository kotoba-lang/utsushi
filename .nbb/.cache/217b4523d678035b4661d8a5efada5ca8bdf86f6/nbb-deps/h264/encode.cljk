  "H.264 baseline-profile Intra_16x16 (LUMA ONLY — see \"Scope\" below)
   reference ENCODER: quantization → forward transform → CAVLC → simple
   mode decision → NAL assembly (ADR-2607122000 `com-junkawasaki/root`
   Migration step 8, the encode-side counterpart of `h264.decode`'s Phase 1
   / \"R0.5\" decoder). Pure cljc, NON-REALTIME, correctness-first reference
   implementation — same tier as `h264.decode`, not a claim of realtime
   encode performance.

   ## Scope (read before assuming this encodes arbitrary images)

   - **Single IDR I-slice covering the whole picture, `mb_type` fixed to
     Intra_16x16** — matches `h264.decode`'s own decode scope exactly (this
     encoder's output is designed to be decoded by THAT decoder, and by any
     spec-conformant real decoder).
   - **LUMA AND CHROMA (Cb/Cr), ChromaArrayType 1 (4:2:0) only** (chroma
     encode addition, ADR-2607122000 Migration step 8 follow-up). Real
     chroma DC (2x2 Hadamard, `nC==-1` special CAVLC table) and chroma AC
     (regular neighbor-derived 4x4 blocks, QPc-scaled) residual is encoded
     from the actual `:cb`/`:cr` source planes — decoded Cb/Cr planes are a
     real (lossy, quantization-bounded) reconstruction of the source's
     chroma content, not a flat DC-only placeholder. `:cb`/`:cr` are
     OPTIONAL in `encode-idr-luma-frame`'s input map — when omitted, they
     default to flat 128-valued planes (preserving this fn's original
     luma-only call shape/behavior for existing callers/tests: DC
     prediction against a locally-constant 128 source always gives zero
     residual, so `CodedBlockPatternChroma` degenerates to 0 exactly as the
     original luma-only encoder always wrote it).
   - **Chroma intra prediction mode decision: DC/Horizontal/Vertical only**
     (Table 8-5 numbering, matching `h264.intra-pred/predict-chroma-8x8`) —
     no Plane (mode 3). This mirrors the luma mode decision's own SAD-only,
     no-RDO simplification (see below) and is a DELIBERATE scope cut,
     unlike `h264.decode`'s chroma path (which DOES implement Plane,
     because a real encoder — libx264 — was observed choosing it even for
     near-flat content, see `h264.intra-pred`'s docstring): this simplified
     reference ENCODER never emits `intra_chroma_pred_mode`=3, so nothing
     here exercises decode's Plane path. `intra_chroma_pred_mode` is a
     SINGLE syntax element shared by both Cb and Cr (§7.3.5.1) — mode
     decision jointly minimizes COMBINED Cb+Cr SAD, not per-component.
   - **Simplified mode decision**: for each macroblock, DC/Vertical/
     Horizontal Intra_16x16 prediction (whichever are available given
     neighbor availability) are each tried and the one minimizing SAD
     against the source is chosen. No Plane, no RDO (rate-distortion
     optimization) — a real encoder's mode decision is far more
     sophisticated; this is explicitly the \"簡易モード決定\" the task scope
     allows.
   - **Constant QP across the whole frame** (`mb_qp_delta` is always 0 —
     the slice's single QP, from the PPS's `pic_init_qp`, applies to every
     macroblock uniformly). No per-MB rate control. QPc (`h264.quant/chroma-qp`,
     from PPS `chroma_qp_index_offset`) is therefore ALSO constant across
     the whole frame (derived once from the constant QPy, since
     `mb_qp_delta`=0 means QPy never actually varies per-MB despite the
     bitstream nominally allowing it).
   - **`CodedBlockPatternLuma`**: 0 (DC-only) if every block's AC-quantized
     levels are all zero, else 15 (full AC for all 16 4x4 blocks) — mirrors
     the two real values `h264.decode`'s `i16x16-mb-info` recognizes.
   - **`CodedBlockPatternChroma`**: 0 (no chroma residual at all) if BOTH
     components' quantized DC levels are all zero, 1 (DC only) if some DC
     level is nonzero but no AC level is, else 2 (DC+AC) — mirrors
     `h264.decode/i16x16-mb-info`'s three real values (`(mod (quot m 4) 3)`).

   ## Why the AC quantizer here is NOT a memorized textbook MF table

   H.264's encoder-side forward quantization is explicitly NON-NORMATIVE
   (ITU-T H.264 / ISO/IEC 14496-10 — only the DECODER's dequant + inverse
   transform is spec-normative). Real encoders (JM reference software,
   x264) use their own independently-chosen forward-quant (\"MF\") tables.
   Rather than trust a memorized MF/forward-transform pairing — which was
   empirically found (see ADR-2607122000 session notes' probe scripts) to
   leave MEASURABLY MORE cross-coefficient leakage (~20%) than this
   pipeline's own inherent non-orthogonality (~2%, a real, expected
   property of H.264's integer transform, not a bug) — this namespace
   quantizes AC coefficients by solving the EXACT least-squares inverse of
   THIS REPO'S OWN already bit-exact-vs-real-ffmpeg-tested
   `h264.quant/ac-qmul` + `h264.transform/inverse-4x4` pipeline, directly
   from pixel-domain residuals. `level-pixel-matrix` below builds the exact
   16x16 \"integer level → reconstructed pixel\" matrix by probing those
   real functions (impulse level=64, chosen so the dequant step's own
   internal rounding is exact); `ac-solver` inverts the AC (non-DC)
   15-column submatrix via exact Gauss-Jordan elimination
   (`mat-inverse`, using Clojure's native ratio arithmetic on JVM —
   degrades gracefully to double-precision floats on ClojureScript, still
   correct to reasonable precision for this small, diagonally-dominant
   matrix). The luma-DC (Hadamard) path is handled analogously by
   `h264.transform/forward-luma-dc-hadamard`, the exact derived inverse of
   the tested `luma-dc-hadamard` — see that fn's docstring.

   This encoder's neighbor (CAVLC nC / intra-prediction) state is tracked
   from ITS OWN reconstructed pixels (predict + dequantized-residual +
   inverse transform, using the SAME formulas `h264.decode` uses) — NOT the
   original source pixels — matching what any real decoder will
   reconstruct, so subsequent macroblocks' predictions and CAVLC neighbor
   derivation stay in sync with what actually gets decoded.

   New implementation as part of the kotoba-lang reverse-domain
   media/graphics standards-substrate split (com-junkawasaki/root),
   ADR-2607122000 Migration step 8."

   `ac-solver` returns `[MacT (MacT·Mac)^-1]` and `solve-ac-levels` used to
   apply them as TWO rational matrix-vector products per 4x4 block. Two
   things were wrong with that, and only the second is obvious:

   1. The product `(MacT·Mac)^-1 · MacT` does not depend on the block — it is
      a fixed 15x16 matrix per QP. Applying the factors separately redid that
      fold once per block instead of once per QP.
   2. Those products ran in Clojure ratio arithmetic. Every multiply
      allocated a Ratio and normalised by GCD. Measured 2026-07-30 on a real
      720x1280 frame: the whole encode cost 11,957 ms, and a synthetic
      standing in for just these two products cost 13,923 ms — i.e. this was
      effectively ALL of encode time, at ~242 us per 4x4 block.

   So fold it once per QP and carry each row as exact integers over a common
   denominator. This is a re-association plus an exact change of
   representation, NOT an approximation: `solve-ac-levels` stays
   bit-identical to the rational path (asserted in `encode-test` over every
   qp 0..51 plus edge vectors). That distinction matters because this repo
   chose an exact solve over a memorized MF table deliberately — a memorized
   table measured ~20% cross-coefficient leakage versus this pipeline's ~2%

;;

;;       (the OWN reconstructed pixels of that frame, not the original
;;       source — matching what a real decoder will actually have available,
;;       same "encoder reconstructs from its own dequantized output" design
;;       already used for intra neighbor state above).
;;     - Two mb_types: P_Skip (mv = the P_Skip predictor, §8.4.1.1, NO
;;       residual) and P_L0_16x16 (one 16x16 partition, one motion vector,
;;       real CAVLC-coded luma+chroma residual) — no sub-partitioned motion
;;       (P_L0_L0_16x8/P_L0_L0_8x16/P_8x8/P_8x8ref0), matching
;;       `h264.decode/decode-macroblock-p!`'s own throw-on-unsupported scope.
;;       No intra-in-P macroblocks on the ENCODE side (mode decision here
;;       never emits one, even though decode supports them) — this
;;       encoder's motion estimation always finds SOME candidate MV, so
;;       there's no RD reason built into this simplified mode decision to
;;       fall back to intra.
;;     - Motion estimation: integer-pel full search over a small
;;       `search-range` (default ±8 pixels, luma-SAD-minimizing, checked
;;       against `h264.interp/mc-luma-block` so the SAME sub-pel-capable
;;       interpolation the decoder uses is what the search itself is scored
;;       against — no separate "integer-only" fast-path approximation), THEN
;;       a small quarter-pel LOCAL refinement (`me-subpel-refine`, ±3
;;       quarter-samples around the best integer position) — REAL sub-pel
;;       motion vectors are supported end-to-end (this repo's decode side
;;       already handles any (fx,fy), see `h264.interp`), not just a
;;       documented gap.
;;     - P_Skip decision: chosen whenever the P_Skip-predictor MV
;;       (`p-skip-mv`, the SAME §8.4.1.1 predictor `h264.decode` uses)
;;       already gives EXACT (zero-SAD) luma prediction — i.e. whenever no
;;       residual would be needed anyway, so spending bits on an explicit
;;       P_L0_16x16 mb_type + mvd + coded_block_pattern=0 would be strictly
;;       wasteful. This is intentionally a much simpler rule than a real
;;       encoder's full RD mode decision (which would also skip for small-
;;       but-nonzero residual, trading a little quality for bits) — see
;;       `encode-p-slice-mbs!`'s docstring.
;;     - Constant QP across the whole frame, same as `encode-idr-luma-frame`.

;; --- P-slice inter residual is a "regular" 4x4 block for EVERY luma 4x4

;; --- fused, early-abandoning SAD for motion estimation ------------------
;;
;; Both of these compute the SAD between the source block and a candidate
;; WITHOUT materialising the candidate, and abandon it as soon as the running
;; sum exceeds `cutoff` (the returned value is then > cutoff but otherwise
;; meaningless). Two savings over `sad` on an `interp/mc-luma-block` grid, both
;; structural: no grid is allocated per candidate (motion estimation discards
;; every candidate but one), and a candidate already worse than the best so far
;; stops after a row or two.
;;
;; The cutoff is tested per ROW, not per sample: a hopeless candidate exceeds it
;; within a row or two either way, and a per-sample test would add a branch to
;; the inner loop to save little.
;;
;; `>` rather than `>=` is deliberate in BOTH. A candidate whose SAD EQUALS the
;; best so far must be allowed to finish, because `apply min-key` — which
;; `best-mv` replaces — keeps the LAST minimum on a tie (verified against
;; `min-key` directly, not assumed), so abandoning ties would silently change
;; which motion vector the search picks, and with it the encoded bitstream.
;;
;; There is deliberately NO general any-fraction version. There was one, and it
;; became dead the moment both searches got the form specialised for the
;; positions they actually visit: whole-pel for the integer search,
;; a prepared plane region for the sub-pel one.

   at the same single read.

   Worth specialising because every one of `me-full-search`'s candidates is
   whole-pel — 289 of the 338 a macroblock evaluates at the default search
   range — and after the sub-pel search was fixed the integer search became the
   largest single stage of a P frame (~33%, measured by caller attribution).

   Two things are hoisted out of the inner loop. The row's base index is
   computed once per row rather than once per sample. And the common case where
   the whole row segment lies inside the picture is tested once per BLOCK, after
   which no clamping happens at all — which is bit-identical because clamping an
   in-range coordinate is the identity, and the clamped branch is still there for
   blocks that really do hang off an edge.

      choose P_Skip — see namespace docstring for why this is a much
      simpler rule than a real encoder's RD mode decision.
